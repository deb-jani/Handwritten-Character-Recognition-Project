# Handwritten-Character-Recognition-Project
This is a Machine learning project in which a Convolutional neural network(CNN) model will be created with the help of tensorflow and keras which will recognise Handwritten characters, i.e English alphabets from A-Z. The dataset on which the model will be trained contains a large number of images of English alphabets.
